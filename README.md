## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js installed
*   npm or yarn installed
*   A MongoDB Atlas account (or a local MongoDB instance)
*   A free API key from [GroqCloud](https://console.groq.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-health-consultancy-platform.git
    cd ai-health-consultancy-platform
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    *   Create a `.env` file by copying the example:
        ```sh
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Open the new `.env` file and add your secret keys (MongoDB URI, JWT Secret, Groq API Key).

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
    *   The frontend is configured to connect to the backend at `http://localhost:5000`. No `.env` file is needed for local development.

4.  **Run the Application:**
    *   In one terminal, start the backend server (from the `backend` directory):
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
    *   In a second terminal, start the frontend development server (from the `frontend` directory):
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
